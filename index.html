    <h2>Basic Facts</h2>
    <div id="tribe">
    <p>Traditions:  Their two important traditions are basket weaving and rock art. They make the most complex baskets in North America. They can be found in museums around the world. They paint rock in their territory. <br>
    <br>

Beliefs: They believed in supernatural gods. If you are giving things to friends and family don’t expect anything in return from them unless they give something in return for you because they want to. <br>
<br>

Ceremonies: 
While a few other early Californians left rock paintings, the Chumash were among the most interesting in the United States.  These rock paintings probably had some religious or ceremonial function to it. <br> 
<br>
Values: They are patient and wait, they don't like to do everything at the same time and rush. They realize how long they will live and they know their limitations. <br>
<br>
Language:  Their language is Hokan family. <br>
<br>
Clothing: Women wore a double apron of deerskin, hanging from their waist to their knees. The edges are decorated with shells. Men often wear nothing. When it is cold, they would wear skins from rabbits, foxes, and sea otters. Feather cloaks were made by twisting feathers with cord, then weaving it. Necklaces and earring were made by shells and bones. To be decorative, the Chumash decorated themselves by panting on themselves. Each village has a different and special design.
</p>
     
    <h2>Trade</h2>
    
    <p>The Chumash traded things with the Yokut tribe like shells and other shell like items for obsidian, salt, antelope, elk skins, and herbs. They also traded with the Salinan to the north and the Kitanemuk to the east. They also trade big beads made from a Giant Pismo clam. </p>
    
    <h2>Housing</h2>
    
    <p>The Chumash house, which was called ‘ap, was round and shaped like a half of an orange. It was made by setting willow poles(which are thin sticks from willows) in the ground in a circle. The poles were bent in at the top, to form a dome. After that, smaller saplings or branches were tied crosswise. They adapted to their environment because they used rocks to make the shape of their building and then they used the natural resources around them to make it believable that it was like a hill.</p>
    
    <h2>Hunter Gatherer Society</h2>
    
    <p>The Chumash made very good use of natural things. Their diet is rich in acorn meal, fish and shellfish, elderberry, bulbs, roots, and mustard greens. The most important food for the Chumash was the acorn which came from the live oak trees. They ate sea creatures like sharks, sea bass, halibut, mussels, barnacles and clams. The Chumash used the bow and arrow beginning about 1,500 years ago. Before that, they used the spear thrower. They also used a harpoon for fishing. They made hunting tools from deer, bear and quail.</p>
    
    <h2>Geography</h2>
    
    <p>They originally lived in what are now the California coastlands and adjacent inland areas from Malibu northward to Estero Bay, and on the three northern Channel Islands off Santa Barbara. It affected their life because they were near the ocean and they could hunt animals and have clean water to drink. They had a very fine climate so that it was possible to catch fish all year long and they could catch very large fish in the oceans. The weather there was always warm so it was easy to catch a lot of fish. The average temperature in summer was around 77°F. The average temperature in winter was around 65°F.</p>
    
    <h2>Natural Resources</h2>
    
    <p>The Chumash used rocks to make their houses and they cattails and bulrush from a tree  to cover the stones and make it more decorative. The Chumash girls and women would pick food and cook for their family and the men would hunt for meat while the women cook. They had willow poles and they had a lot of food because they were near the Pacific Ocean. The Chumash made a variety of tools out of wood, whalebone, and other materials, fashioned vessels of soapstone.</p>

    <h1>About the Creator</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! I am Carl_Panda2000. But, Carl_Panda2000 isn&#x27t my Github username. I'm in 4th grade. You might think a forth-grader can't do this much! But, they can! To get back to what I want to talk about, I am researching about the Chumash in class. Well, obviously, the teachers would not make us create a website. This is just for fun! I created this website on Khan Academy, then copy and pasted it on W3Schools, Then I pasted it on Github. Sorry, though, it ends in <q>.github.io</q>. But, <q>.com</q> costs money, so thats why it ends in <q>.github.io</q>. Instead of me playing video games, I created this website. This is my first website, I feel so proud, so please like this to make me more proud, I would very appreciate it a lot. Thank you for your time!</p>
